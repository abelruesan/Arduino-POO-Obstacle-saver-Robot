# Arduino-POO-Obstacle-saver-Robot

Robot that avoids obstacles with an ultrasonic sensor made with POO on Arduino.

The robot's body has been completely designed in 3D to be able to print it. 

The PDF file includes an appendix explaining how the ultrasonic sensor works.

There is a .zip file containing the savaobstáculos robot library. 

If you want to use the zip file, simply install the library in the Arduino IDE and then use the program located in the “ProgramWithZip” folder.

If you do not want to use the .zip file, open the programs in the “ProgramsWithoutZip” folder.

I hope you like my project.
